#' Generates a cohort of the drug use of a certain list of concepts.
#'
#' @param cdm A cdm_reference object.
#' @param name Name of the GeneratedCohortSet
#' @param atcName Names of ATC of interest.
#' @param durationRange Range between the duration must be comprised. It should
#' be a numeric vector of length two, with no NAs and the first value should be
#' equal or smaller than the second one. It is only required if imputeDuration
#' = TRUE. If NULL no restrictions are applied.
#' @param imputeDuration Whether/how the duration should be imputed
#' "none", "median", "mean", "mode", or it can be a count
#' @param gapEra Number of days between two continuous exposures to be
#' considered in the same era.
#' @param priorUseWashout Prior days without exposure.
#' @param priorObservation Minimum number of days of prior observation
#' required for the incident eras to be considered.
#' @param cohortDateRange Range for cohort_start_date and cohort_end_date
#' @param limit Choice on how to summarise the exposures. There are
#' two options:
#' "all" we summarise the output will be a summary of the exposed eras of
#' each individual. Each individual can contribute multiple times.
#' "first" we only consider the first observable era of each individual that fulfills the criteria provided
#' in previous parameters. In this case each individual can not contribute with multiple rows.
#' @param level ATC level. Can be one or more of "ATC 1st", "ATC 2nd",
#' "ATC 3rd", "ATC 4th", and "ATC 5th"
#' @param doseForm Only descendants codes with the specified dose form
#' will be returned. If NULL, descendant codes will be returned regardless
#' of dose form.
#' @return The function returns the 'cdm' object with the created cohorts as
#' references of the object.
